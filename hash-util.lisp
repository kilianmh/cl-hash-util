;;; cl-hash-util is a very basic library for dealing with CL's hash tables. The
;;; idea was spawned through working with enough JSON APIs and config files,
;;; causing a lot of headaches in the process. For instance, to get a value deep
;;; within a hash, you have to do:
;;;   (gethash "city" (gethash "location" (gethash "user" obj)))
;;;
;;; With cl-hash-util, you can write:
;;;   (hget obj '("user" "location" "city"))
;;;
;;; hget can also deal with getting elements out of lists and arrays:
;;;   (hget obj '("user" "friends" 0 "name"))
;;;
;;; which normally would have to be written as such:
;;;   (gethash "name" (elt (gethash "friends" (gethash "user" obj)) 0))
;;;
;;; ...uuuugly.
;;;
;;; cl-hash-util also provides an easy way to build hash tables on the fly.
;;; Where you'd normally have to do something like:
;;;   (let ((myhash (make-hash-table :test #'equal)))
;;;     (setf (gethash "name" myhash) "andrew")
;;;     (setf (gethash "location" myhash) "santa cruz")
;;;     myhash)
;;;
;;; You can now do:
;;;   (hash-create '(("name" "andrew") ("location" "santa cruz")))
;;;
;;;   -OR-
;;;
;;;   (hash ("name" "andrew") ("location" "santa cruz"))
;;;
;;; You can also do nested hashes:
;;;   (hash ("name" "andrew")
;;;         ("location" (hash ("city" "santa cruz")
;;;                           ("state" "CA"))))
;;;
;;; This saves a lot of typing =].
