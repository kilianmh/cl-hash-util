The first parameter is a list of keys that with-keys will reference in the hash
table provided in the second parameter. With-keys will attempt to convert each
key into a symbol, binding the hash table value to it during body execution.
String keys are upcased before conversion to symbols.

If you don't want with-keys to guess at a symbol for a key, supply a list -
(<symbol> <key>) - in place of the key, as in (loc \"location\") above.

If you want to supply a default value, you have to supply a list -
(<symbol> <key> <default>) - in place of the key, as in (time \"time\" 2024)."

  "A collection macro that builds and outputs a hash table. To add to the hash
table, call the collect function with a key and a value from within the scope
of the collecting-hash-table macro. The value will be inserted or combined with
existing values according to the specified mode.

This code collects words into bins based on their length:

```common-lisp
(collecting-hash-table (:mode :append)
  (dotimes (i 10)
    (let ((word (format nil \"~r\" i)))
      (collect (length word) word)))
  ```
  Result: <hash table: 5 => (\"three\" \"seven\" \"eight\")
                       3 => (\"one\" \"two\" \"six\")
                       4 => (\"zero\" \"four\" \"five\" \"nine\")>

  The mode can be set in the parameters section of collecting-hash-table with the
  :mode keyword. The :mode keyword can also be passed to individual collect calls.

  Keyword parameters:

  :test - Test function parameter passed to make-hash-table when creating a new
  hash table

  :existing - Pass an existing hash table to the macro for modification. Using
  this option at the same time as :test will result in an error.

  :mode - Set the default mode for the collect function. Modes are :replace :keep
  :tally :sum :append :push :concatenate or a function that will be applied in a
  reduce-like fashion to the existing and new values of a key."
